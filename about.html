      <h1>About</h1>
      <p class="size-large">
        Hi, Iâ€™m Moruf. I'm a multi-talented human with over 3+ years <br />
        of experiences in front-end Development.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have a strong technical background in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript as a
        frontend developer, and I have <br />
        experience with well-known frameworks like React and Bootstrap. My
        emphasis on user-centered design <br />
        guarantees that interfaces are clear and attractive, and my aptitude for
        problem-solving enables effective <br />
        issue resolution. I speak well, work well in collaborative team
        settings, and rapidly learn new tasks. <br />
        In addition, I successfully manage projects while keeping up with
        business trends and exhibiting <br />
        a dedication to lifelong learning. I can design excellent, user-friendly
        web interfaces that satisfy <br />
        the needs of both users and stakeholders thanks to my talents and
        experience.
      </p>
      <p>
        The work I've done doesn't always define who I am. My career goals serve
        <br />
        as my definition of who I am. Personality is innate, but skills may be
        taught. <br />
        Continue learning, pushing oneself, and engaging in worthwhile and
        fascinating <br />activities are what I like to do.
      </p>
      <p>
        My passion and energy never cease, which makes me easily motivated and
        willing to pursue my hobbies wherever they <br />
        may lead. I'm a gifted, outgoing, and energetic individual with a talent
        for making others laugh and feel inspired. For me, <br />
        simply coming up with ideas is never sufficient. Instead, I have a
        near-compulsive need to do action. I have a lot of energy <br />
        and desire to pursue
